# Differential Hi-C Data Analysis Workshop

This tutorial is an introductory guide into differential Hi-C data analysis. It includes joint normalization of Hi-C data matrices and the detection of differential chromatin interactions. Preprocessing and extraction of Hi-C data matrices are introduced. Examples of downstream analysis of differentially interacting chromatin regions and guidelines on how to visualize and interpret the results are also provided.

Please, refer to the [hic_tutorial.Rmd](vignettes/hic_tutorial.Rmd) vignette for more details. This workshop is based on the [Paper: Stansfield et al., “R Tutorial: Detection of Differentially Interacting Chromatin Regions From Multiple Hi-C Datasets.”](https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cpbi.76). The workshop demonstrates functionality of the following R packages:

* [HiCcompare](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/HiCcompare)
* [multiHiCcompare](https://bioconductor.org/packages/multiHiCcompare)

The tutorial has been developed to be presented at the [Bioconductor Conference 2020](https://bioc2020.bioconductor.org/), July 27-July 31 in Boston, MA.
