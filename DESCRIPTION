Description: This tutorial will introduce methods for the comparative
    (aka differential) analysis of the three-dimensional (3D) 
    structure of the genome using data generated by high throughput 
    chromatin conformation capture (Hi-C) technologies. Hi-C data 
    allows for insights into the genome-wide genomic interactions 
    which play an important role in the regulation of the genome. 
    Just as differential expression analyses using RNA-seq data have 
    become a routine part of genomic experiments, we expect 
    the differential analysis of genomic interactions to become 
    a common task for a bioinformatician. This workflow will help 
    a novice learn to perform differential analysis of two or more 
    Hi-C datasets and interpret the results of the differential 
    genomic interactions.
